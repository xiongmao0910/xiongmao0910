                        Hello! My name is Trung, and I enjoy learning about the
                        world around us. My interest in web programming began in
                        my third year of university, when I was introduced to
                        topics such as website administration and system
                        construction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On April 7, this year, I was privileged to obtain a new
                        engineering degree from the university where I am
                        currently enrolled. In the days following graduation, my
                        main objective was to approach, learn, and improve the
                        abilities required to become a professional web
                        developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently, in addition to acquiring new web development
                        skills, I also discovered intriguing knowledge such as
                        data structures and algorithms, design with figma, and
                        design with figma from reading tutorials. blog or
                        watching video lessons on social networking platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been learning with
                        recently:
